# Overview

I created pong using the Python Arcade library. The controls are very simple and listed below:

W -> Move leftside paddle up
S -> Move leftside paddle down

UP ARROW -> Move rightside paddle up
DOWN ARROW -> Move rightside paddle down

SPACE -> Begin the game. The ball will pick a random direction and begin moving.

P -> Pause game
TAB -> Switch between 1 player and 2 player mode
ESC -> Quit game

I created this game in order to begin learning how to make games. I used arcade since
it is a Pythonm library and Python is the language I know the best.
